# Demo files for a new website #

This is my little working document where I'm sandboxing a new website that actually uses CSS.

## To do: ##

1. Figure out the file structure.
2. Put all the scores in the score folder
3. Figure out the best solution for hosting audio for streaming.
4. Update with new compositions from concert (scores/audio)
