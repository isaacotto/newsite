# Demo files for a new website #

This is my little working document where I'm sandboxing a new website that actually uses CSS.

## To do: ##

1. Figure out the file structure.
    - One folder for all scores should be fine.
    - It seems like a bad idea to host audio locally but I guess I could.
    - If I need sub-sites where would those go? Maybe in a "pages" folder.
2. Put all the scores in the score folder
3. Figure out the best solution for hosting audio for streaming.
4. Update with new compositions from concert (scores/audio)

(Maybe I could do something fancy like having two independently-scrolling columns---one of which is a quasi-blog in which to put little updates...)
