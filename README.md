# Demo files for a new website #

This is my little working document where I'm sandboxing a new website that actually uses CSS.

## To do: ##

1. Find code for a guestbook (actually probably low priority)
2. Filter content into relevant sub-pages
3. Find good embedded players (bandcamp, youtube?)
4. Host dissertation on-site?  

--------------------
1. Figure out the file structure.
    - One folder for all scores should be fine.
    - It seems like a bad idea to host audio locally but I guess I could.
    - If I need sub-sites where would those go? Maybe in a "pages" folder.
2. Put all the scores in the score folder
3. Figure out the best solution for hosting audio for streaming.
4. Update with new compositions from concert (scores/audio)

Maybe I could do something fancy like having two independently-scrolling columns---one of which is a quasi-blog in which to put little updates...

There's a solution to this given [here](https://jsfiddle.net/wQ6WQ/1/) which was originally linked from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15453410/independent-column-scroll-in-html-page).
