            There is something kind of evil about using a monospace font then applying justification to it. Nothing's going to line up properly in the same way it would in a text editor. I'll have to think about this. I don't want to leave it ragged-right, but that might be the most spiritually-correct option. <br><br>

            Actually, as it turns out the *real* best option is just to leave ragged right and allow hyphenation. I think it knows what it's doing in that regard.

          This div takes up the width specified in CSS and the remaining space is split equally between the two margins. Now I've got beautiful justified text inside this box in the middle of the page and space for art. I think this is gonna have to be the new format.

          Here's a new paragraph. With this class there should always be a 1cm buffer after the paragraph. It's figuring out when to leave a ragged line.
